	<h1>This is just a review of their site layout... nothing person.</h1>
	<p>I think that this site has a lot of good content but the content is not very interactive and doesn't bring you in at all. It is pretty much just headings and paragraphs. Visually there is nothing breaking up the content or bringing interest. All the visual interest comes from the advertisements that aren't related.</p>
