	<h2>Everyone should nap like their inner child: </h2>
	<p>There is nothing like a good nap with a nice stretch after it to reset your mood and your day. Whether you are overtired, overworked, or overstressed napping is where it is at. Some people think napping is just for babies and the elderly but I say it's for everyone! Just make sure you get the timing of your naps right or else you will end up even more groggy then before. Take a nap between 10 - 20 minutes and you will wake up refreshed with a bit of energy. This is perfect for the lunchtime napper. If you nap longer and your nap ranges between 30 - 60 minutes, I call this the monster zone. You will wake up a monster and everyone will be in the path of your monstrous wrath. The good news is if you can make it to an hour and a half nap you will have a full cycle of sleep and wake up ready to go take on the world! Who are you, you lucky person with enough time mid-day to take over an hour and a half nap? Now that you know a bit more about how long to nap lets get into the benefits of napping and some pro napping tips.</p>
